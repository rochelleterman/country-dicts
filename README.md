# country-dicts
Dictionaries to categorize text by topic country.

### The Problem
You have texts, e.g. news articles. You want to know what country the text is about. 

### The Solution
Make a big dictionary of key-value pairs corresponding to specific countries. For example, "Saddam Hussein" corresponds to "Iraq."

It's not fancy, but you'd be surprised how well it works.

### The Data
`country-codes.csv` contains those key-value pairs, along with Correlates of War numeric country codes, region, and iso3c codes. 

### Want to help?
Pull request your key-value pairs and I'll merge it with this dictionary.
